/*
GeoJSON is a standard JSON format to represent geographic data. A point looks like this:
{
  "type": "Point",
  "coordinates": [longitude, latitude]
}

MongoDB understands this format for geospatial queries like $near. 
impotant for using location-based features in your app.

Why it’s needed

Without a 2dsphere index:
MongoDB doesn’t know location contains geographical coordinates.
Geospatial queries like $near, $geoWithin, $nearSphere will not work.
Queries would be slow if MongoDB had to scan every document.

With a 2dsphere index:
MongoDB can efficiently calculate distances between points on Earth.
You can query “memories near me” or “memories within 5 km” quickly.


Why a “2dsphere” Index Is Different

Most indexes deal with numbers or text.
A 2dsphere index is special — it’s designed for geographical data (longitude/latitude).
It doesn’t just sort by number order — it understands Earth’s spherical geometry.
That means it can efficiently answer questions like:
“Which memories are within 5 km of this point?”

That’s not simple sorting — that’s distance-based searching on a curved surface (Earth).
